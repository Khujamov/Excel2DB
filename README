How to clone and build the project from the GitHub 

1. Create a folder we you want to handle the project and clone the 
project from the GitHub by running 
"git clone https://github.com/palych-piter/Excel2DB.git". 
The Excel2Db subfolder should be created.

2. Run the "gradlew shadowJar" gradle command. You should have the 
Gradle pre-installed.

3. All is set. The "build/libs/" subfolder should have the newest jar file
generated. By default the subfolder contains the property file pointing to
the Derby database as the testing implementation and test.xlsx 
as the test Excel file.
